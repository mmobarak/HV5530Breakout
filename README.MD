# HV5530 Breakout Board

This is a breakout board for the [MicroChip HV 5530](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/OTH/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/20005851A.pdf) Serial to Parallel Converter.

The component is only available as an SMD part and it doesn't quite fit on a QFP44 footprint, so a custom breakout board is necessary for breadboard prototyping.

This project is a KiCad 8 import of the Eagle CAD project  developed by [Frederick L](https://hackaday.io/Fredovsky) as part of his [French Nixie Hackaday Project](https://hackaday.io/project/158949-french-nixie-clock).
