Often used as Generic Header-pin footprint for 0.1 inch spaced/style header connections\n\nOn any of the 0.1 inch spaced packages, you can populate with these:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116  Break Away Headers - Straight (PRT-00116)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/553  Break Away Male Headers - Right Angle (PRT-00553)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115  Female Headers (PRT-00115)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/117  Break Away Headers - Machine Pin (PRT-00117)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/743  Break Away Female Headers - Swiss Machine Pin (PRT-00743)\n\nFor SCREWTERMINALS and SPRING TERMINALS visit here:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=Screw+Terminals  Screw Terimnals on SparkFun.com (5mm/3.5mm/2.54mm spacing)\n\nThis device is also useful as a general connection point to wire up your design to another part of your project. Our various solder wires solder well into these plated through hole pads.\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11375  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Stranded, 22 AWG) (PRT-11375)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Solid Core, 22 AWG) (PRT-11367)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/141  View the entire wire category on our website here\n\nSpecial notes:\n\nMolex polarized connector foot print use with SKU : PRT-08231 with associated crimp pins and housings. 1MM SMD Version SKU: PRT-10208\n\nNOTES ON THE VARIANTS LOCK and LOCK_LONGPADS... This footprint was designed to help hold the alignment of a through-hole component (i.e.  6-pin header) while soldering it into place. You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a \"brace\" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of \"off-center\" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.\n\nNote about LOCK SPECIAL package:\n\nThis is just like the LOCK variant in that the holes are staggared by 5 mil, but except for the last two holes.  They are not altered from the \"standard\" footprint layout.  This is used for a special purpose on the layout of our Graphic LCD Backpack.

Often used as Generic Header-pin footprint for 0.1 inch spaced/style header connections\n\nOn any of the 0.1 inch spaced packages, you can populate with these:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116  Break Away Headers - Straight (PRT-00116)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/553  Break Away Male Headers - Right Angle (PRT-00553)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115  Female Headers (PRT-00115)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/117  Break Away Headers - Machine Pin (PRT-00117)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/743  Break Away Female Headers - Swiss Machine Pin (PRT-00743)\n\nFor SCREWTERMINALS and SPRING TERMINALS visit here:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=Screw+Terminals  Screw Terimnals on SparkFun.com (5mm/3.5mm/2.54mm spacing)\n\nThis device is also useful as a general connection point to wire up your design to another part of your project. Our various solder wires solder well into these plated through hole pads.\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11375  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Stranded, 22 AWG) (PRT-11375)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Solid Core, 22 AWG) (PRT-11367)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/141  View the entire wire category on our website here\n\nSpecial notes:\n\nMolex polarized connector foot print use with SKU : PRT-08231 with associated crimp pins and housings. 1MM SMD Version SKU: PRT-10208\n\nNOTES ON THE VARIANTS LOCK and LOCK_LONGPADS... This footprint was designed to help hold the alignment of a through-hole component (i.e.  6-pin header) while soldering it into place. You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a \"brace\" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of \"off-center\" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.\n\nNote about LOCK SPECIAL package:\n\nThis is just like the LOCK variant in that the holes are staggared by 5 mil, but except for the last two holes.  They are not altered from the \"standard\" footprint layout.  This is used for a special purpose on the layout of our Graphic LCD Backpack.  Make sure you want to use this device before selecting it for you project!"

Often used as Generic Header-pin footprint for 0.1 inch spaced/style header connections\n\nOn any of the 0.1 inch spaced packages, you can populate with these:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116  Break Away Headers - Straight (PRT-00116)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/553  Break Away Male Headers - Right Angle (PRT-00553)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115  Female Headers (PRT-00115)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/117  Break Away Headers - Machine Pin (PRT-00117)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/743  Break Away Female Headers - Swiss Machine Pin (PRT-00743)\n\nFor SCREWTERMINALS and SPRING TERMINALS visit here:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=Screw+Terminals  Screw Terimnals on SparkFun.com (5mm/3.5mm/2.54mm spacing)\n\nThis device is also useful as a general connection point to wire up your design to another part of your project. Our various solder wires solder well into these plated through hole pads.\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11375  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Stranded, 22 AWG) (PRT-11375)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Solid Core, 22 AWG) (PRT-11367)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/141  View the entire wire category on our website here\n\nSpecial notes:\n\nMolex polarized connector foot print use with SKU : PRT-08231 with associated crimp pins and housings. 1MM SMD Version SKU: PRT-10208\n\nNOTES ON THE VARIANTS LOCK and LOCK_LONGPADS... This footprint was designed to help hold the alignment of a through-hole component (i.e.  6-pin header) while soldering it into place. You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a \"brace\" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of \"off-center\" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.\n\nNote about LOCK SPECIAL package:\n\nThis is just like the LOCK variant in that the holes are staggared by 5 mil, but except for the last two holes.  They are not altered from the \"standard\" footprint layout.  This is used for a special purpose on the layout of our Graphic LCD Backpack.  Make sure you want to use this device before selecting it for you project!"

		(property "Description" "Multi connection point. Often used as Generic Header-pin footprint for 0.1 inch spaced/style header connections\n\nOn any of the 0.1 inch spaced packages, you can populate with these:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116  Break Away Headers - Straight (PRT-00116)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/553  Break Away Male Headers - Right Angle (PRT-00553)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115  Female Headers (PRT-00115)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/117  Break Away Headers - Machine Pin (PRT-00117)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/743  Break Away Female Headers - Swiss Machine Pin (PRT-00743)\n\nFor SCREWTERMINALS and SPRING TERMINALS visit here:\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=Screw+Terminals  Screw Terimnals on SparkFun.com (5mm/3.5mm/2.54mm spacing)\n\nThis device is also useful as a general connection point to wire up your design to another part of your project. Our various solder wires solder well into these plated through hole pads.\n\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11375  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Stranded, 22 AWG) (PRT-11375)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367  Hook-Up Wire - Assortment (Solid Core, 22 AWG) (PRT-11367)\n• https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/141  View the entire wire category on our website here\n\nSpecial notes:\n\nMolex polarized connector foot print use with SKU : PRT-08231 with associated crimp pins and housings. 1MM SMD Version SKU: PRT-10208\n\nNOTES ON THE VARIANTS LOCK and LOCK_LONGPADS... This footprint was designed to help hold the alignment of a through-hole component (i.e.  6-pin header) while soldering it into place. You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a \"brace\" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of \"off-center\" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side.\n\nNote about LOCK SPECIAL package:\n\nThis is just like the LOCK variant in that the holes are staggared by 5 mil, but except for the last two holes.  They are not altered from the \"standard\" footprint layout.  This is used for a special purpose on the layout of our Graphic LCD Backpack.  Make sure you want to use this device before selecting it for you project!"
